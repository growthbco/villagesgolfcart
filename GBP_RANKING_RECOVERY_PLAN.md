# Google Business Profile Ranking Recovery Plan
## Golf Cart Rentals The Villages FL

### Current Status Analysis
- Schema markup is comprehensive but missing critical Google Business Profile link
- Review schema is present with 4.9 rating and 527 reviews
- Multiple location pages exist (good for local SEO)
- NAP consistency needs verification across all pages

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Week 1)

### 1. Add Google Business Profile Link to Schema ✅ HIGH PRIORITY
**Issue**: Schema markup is missing the `sameAs` field linking to your Google Business Profile
**Action**: Add your GBP URL to the schema markup

**Your GBP URL Format** (find this in your Google Business Profile):
- Format: `https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:YOUR_PLACE_ID`
- OR: `https://maps.google.com/?cid=YOUR_CID_NUMBER`

**Impact**: This directly connects your website to your GBP listing, which is critical for rankings.

---

### 2. Ensure NAP Consistency Across All Pages ✅ HIGH PRIORITY
**Current NAP** (from your homepage schema):
- **Name**: Golf Cart Rentals The Villages FL
- **Address**: 12885 S US Hwy 441, Belleview, FL 34420
- **Phone**: 352-306-4409

**Action Items**:
- Verify this exact NAP appears on every page (header, footer, contact page)
- Ensure phone number format is consistent (use: `352-306-4409` everywhere)
- Check all location-specific pages use the same base address

**Impact**: Google penalizes inconsistent NAP information, which directly hurts GBP rankings.

---

### 3. Optimize Google Business Profile Listing
**Checklist**:
- [ ] Verify business hours are accurate and match website
- [ ] Add/update business description with keywords: "golf cart rental", "The Villages FL"
- [ ] Add all service categories (Golf Cart Rental, Vehicle Rental, etc.)
- [ ] Upload high-quality photos (at least 10 photos showing your carts)
- [ ] Add Google Posts weekly with updates, offers, or tips
- [ ] Ensure primary category is "Golf Cart Rental" or "Vehicle Rental"
- [ ] Add attributes: "Open 7 Days", "Free Delivery", "24-Hour Service"

---

### 4. Generate More Recent Reviews ✅ HIGH PRIORITY
**Current**: 4.9 stars with 527 reviews (excellent!)

**Action Plan**:
- Set up automated review request emails after each rental
- Add review request links to receipts/invoices
- Create a review request page on website with direct links to GBP
- Respond to ALL reviews (especially new ones) within 24-48 hours
- Ask satisfied customers personally for reviews
